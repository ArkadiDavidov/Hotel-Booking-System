# Hotel Booking System

A C++ console application that allows users to browse hotels in different cities and view pricing information. The system loads data from text files and provides an interactive interface for searching and displaying hotel details.

## Features
âœ” City-Based Hotel Search â€“ Browse available hotels by city.
âœ” Price Information â€“ View detailed pricing for selected hotels.
âœ” Text Database Integration â€“ Loads hotel and price data from .txt files.
âœ” Case-Insensitive Search â€“ Finds hotels regardless of input case.
âœ” Multiple Selection â€“ View details for one or all hotels at once.

## How It Works

### Data Loading

HotelDatabase reads hotels_database.txt (structured by city).

PriceDatabase reads price_database.txt (maps hotels to prices).

### User Interaction

Users select a city to view available hotels.

They can then:

Enter specific hotel names (comma-separated).

Type all to display all hotels in the city.

### Price Display

The system retrieves and formats pricing data for selected hotels.
